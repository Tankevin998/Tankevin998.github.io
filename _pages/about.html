I am a first-year PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Yiannis-Kantaros.html">Yiannis Kantaros</a>.

Before starting the PhD, I spent 7 months as a research intern in Robotics and Sensor Physics department at Schlumberger-Doll Research. I received B.Eng degree in Software Engineering at Sun Yat-Sen University in 2019 and MSE in Robotics at <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/jun-wang/">GRASP Lab</a>, University of Pennsylvania in 2021. I was an exchange student at SungKyunKwan University in 2018.

The name of this webpage "<strong>wonggwan</strong>" comes from the pronunciation of my name in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese">Cantonese</a>. I can speak English and Korean fluently while being a native speaker in Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese.
