I am a research associate intern in the Department of Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.tbeckers.com/">Thomas Beckers</a>.

Before this, I received M.S. in Electrical Engineering at Washington University in St.Louis. I received B.Eng in Software Engineering at Sun Yat-Sen University in 2019 and M.S.E in Robotics at <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/jun-wang/">GRASP Lab</a>, University of Pennsylvania in 2021. I was an exchange student at SungKyunKwan University in 2018.

The name of this webpage "<strong>wonggwan</strong>" comes from the pronunciation of my name in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese">Cantonese</a>. I can speak English and Korean fluently while being a native speaker in Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese. My research interests include machine learning, control, and robotics.
